* Common to all actions
- Build a fn
- Eval interceptor map vals
- Print for round-trip as literal (complected with data-readers.clj)

* Should be common to all actions
- Header handling
- Params map

* Data creating / transforming actions
- "To" and "From"

* Asymmetries

[1] Feature exists but differs from other implementations
[2] Chains to next interceptor but discards any problems detected.
[3] Only uses merged params when =request-params-path= not
specified. (Request-params-path is similar to =:from=)
